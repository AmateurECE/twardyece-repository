This repository stores information that I've found useful in a few different
situations. This includes things like:

1. Instructions for doing complicated stuff that I have to do often
2. Instructions for doing stuff that I don't have to do very often
3. Instructions for doing stuff that took me a long time to figure out, that I might
  one day have to do again.

If it helps you, as well, then welcome! That would be by coincidence.
